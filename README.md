User Defined Language Theme Switcher for Notepad++
=============

User Dafined Languages (UDL) for source code editor [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is usually created for "Default" style theme
and if you are using non-default style theme, then UDL code highlighting makes code unreadable.
This application can convert UDL code highlighting style to other Notepad++ supported style themes.

Note: conversion is not perfect, so backup your UDL before converting.
